## Features
- Fetches trivia questions from an API (OpenTDB).
- Displays the questions and their respective answers in a table format.
- Allows users to download the questions as JSON or CSV.
- Allows users to print the data on the browser console.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/codehrh/api_fetching_app`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd api_fetching_app`
3. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
4. Start the Rails server: `rails s`
5. Open the application in your browser by visiting: `http://localhost:3000` or `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

## Usage
1. Input your desired number of questions (between 1 and 15) and press "Fetch Trivia" to load the corresponding number of questions.
2. The **"Download as JSON"** and **"Download as CSV"** buttons can be used to save the questions in JSON and CSV formats.
3. The **"Print to Console"** button displays the questions stored in the session in the browser console (accessible via Developer Tools).

## Notes
1. Opening the page will automatically load 15 true or false trivia questions.
2. `session[:trivia_questions]` is used to keep track of the questions, which are also displayed in the table.
3. The questions are limited to only true or false questions, and only the necessary fields (`question` and `correct_answer`) are stored to minimize session storage.
4. Fetching trivia questions is restricted to 1 to 15 questions at a time to prevent cookie overflow.
